            <ol>
                <li>Step 1: firstly, in a large vessel get 2 litre milk of milk to a boil stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Step 2: once the milk comes to a boil, pour 2 tbsp lemon juice and stir well. you can alternatively use curd or vinegar.</li>
                <li>Step 3: stir until the milk curdles keeping the flame on low to medium.</li>
                <li>Step 4: do not boil further once water separates completely.</li>
                <li>Step 5: drain the curdled milk over a cloth-lined over a colander. you can use the leftover water to make soup or knead the dough as they are very nutritious.</li>
                <li>Step 6: squeeze off the water completely. be careful as the curdled milk will be very hot.</li>
				<li>Step 7: rinse off the curdled milk with fresh water to remove sourness from lemon juice.</li>
                <li>Step 8: squeeze off the water completely. do not over squeeze as the moisture in paneer will be lost.</li>
                <li>Step 9: hang for 1 hour making sure the water is drained completely, yet remain the moisture.</li>
                <li>Step 10: drop in rolled paneer balls one by one into boiling sugar water. enjoy once cooled</li>
